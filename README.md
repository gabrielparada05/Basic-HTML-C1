# Chanllenge #1 UofT Cooding Bootcamp
Welcome to my first work on a website! Here are some important details and instructions to help you navigate the website:

## Description
This website was created as a project for the UofT Coding Bootcamp. As part of the curriculum, we were tasked with learning HTML and CSS refactoring a website. This project has given me the opportunity to learn valuable skills and put them into practice in a real-world scenario. I am excited to continue improving my skills and creating more projects in the future.  

The goal was to create a codebase that follows accessibility standards
and to be optimized for search engines. 

So, I added <alt> attributes in every image and <title> in the background-image, adjusted contrast and changed the typography to meet the accessibility standards.  Also, I overwrite some elements to convert them into semantic HTML elements and get a better structure of the HTML. 

The images were resized to 50% to make the website faster. 

## Getting started
To access the website, simply type in the website address into your web browser. Once the website loads, you will be presented with the homepage. From there, you can navigate to different sections of the website using the menu bar at the top of the page.

A screenshot is available inside the assets folder.
